# Crowdedness at Gym <hr>

<h3>Background:</h3>
<i>When is my university campus gym least crowded, so I know when to work out? We measured how many people were in this gym once every 10 minutes over the last year. We want to be able to predict how crowded the gym will be in the future.</i>

<h3>Goals:</h3>
<i>1. Given a time of day (and maybe some other features, including weather), predict how crowded the gym will be. <br>
2. Figure out which features are actually important, which are redundant, and what features could be added to make the predictions more accurate.</i>
